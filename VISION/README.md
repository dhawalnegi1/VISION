VISION - Vigilant Image Sensing Intelligent drONe 

VISION is an intelligent drone  that steps up the survelliance techniques by collecting and analyzing  a real time video stream with the power of computer vision and AI recognition capabilities. It enables surreptitious gathering of information about a target by capturing data from a distance or altitude.Dronesâ€™ flight capabilities, small size and ability to withstand harsh environments imply that they can often survey subjects that might not be accessible otherwise and can provide a first-person view (FPV) that would normally be impossible for a photographer.It is combined with computer vision, face recognition, object recognition and other tracking technologies.The Camera module of the drone can follow a person around while recording 4k video.Their naturalization into the environment -- sometimes referred to as ubiquitous robotics -- is enabled by the amalgamation of neural networks,robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). It is an advanced AI-powered drone that can adapt to the environment and perform many autonomous tasks like following a subject and streaming a live video while it hovers over an area.VISION can be used by government agencies to gain intelligence against enemy targets and by  business competitors for high-level competitive intelligence (CI) gathering. Other applications of this project  include survelliance, law enforcement, private investigation, spying, disaster recovery, search and rescue, drone journalism, photography,catch criminal suspects,screen passengers at railway stations and military reconnaissance.

Usage:

Well this model is defined and implementation of facenet paper published in Arxiv (FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering). And also contain the idea of two paper named as "A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition" and "Deep Face Recognition". For deep understanding about its concept you can follow upper paper. One also main part is that for genearating your own model you can follow this link Face Recognition using Tensorflow. David Sandberg (https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) have nicely implemnted you can also find it on Github for complete code and uses.
